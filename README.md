# Obsidian-pisum

- This is an [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) theme using a color scheme inspired by [obsidian_gruvbox](https://github.com/insanum/obsidian_gruvbox) and [Qiita](https://github.com/increments/vscode-qiita). 
- Only dark mode is available, but I set the light mode to be an [Andy_Matuschak mode](https://notes.andymatuschak.org) which must be a credit to [death_au](https://github.com/deathau) 's brilliant solution.
- Scrollbar is put back considering the user using PC or Linux. Mac user can remove the scrollbar by manually reactivate the code in the end of the css file.
- The css file is a bit big but with detailed comments that is inspired by [Reggie](https://github.com/pgalliford)'s [Hulk theme](https://github.com/pgalliford/Obsidian-theme-Incredible-Hulk).
